To create a simple yet secure password manager in Python, we will use `cryptography` to encrypt passwords, along with basic file handling to save and retrieve passwords. For simplicity, we'll focus on these key features:

1. **Password Encryption**: Use `cryptography` to securely store passwords.
2. **Password Management**: Allow adding, retrieving, and deleting passwords.
3. **Authentication**: Protect the app with a master password.

### Steps:
1. **Installation**:
   You need to install the `cryptography` library for encryption:
   ```bash
   pip install cryptography
   ```

2. **Basic Outline of the Password Manager**:
   - The passwords will be stored in an encrypted file.
   - Use a master password to encrypt and decrypt the passwords.
   - Use `cryptography.fernet` for symmetric encryption (AES encryption).
   - Add functions to add, retrieve, and delete passwords securely.

Here's the Python script for a basic password manager:

### Python Script for Password Manager:

```python
import os
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import base64
import getpass
import json

# Generate a key from the master password
def generate_key(master_password: str) -> bytes:
    # Use SHA256 to create a consistent key from the master password
    key = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(master_password.encode('utf-8'))
    return key[:32]  # Fernet requires a 32-byte key

# Encrypt data
def encrypt_data(data: str, key: bytes) -> str:
    fernet = Fernet(key)
    encrypted = fernet.encrypt(data.encode('utf-8'))
    return encrypted.decode('utf-8')

# Decrypt data
def decrypt_data(data: str, key: bytes) -> str:
    fernet = Fernet(key)
    decrypted = fernet.decrypt(data.encode('utf-8'))
    return decrypted.decode('utf-8')

# Load the password store
def load_password_store(filename: str) -> dict:
    if os.path.exists(filename):
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            return json.load(file)
    else:
        return {}

# Save the password store
def save_password_store(filename: str, password_store: dict):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        json.dump(password_store, file)

# Add a new password
def add_password(password_store: dict, key: bytes):
    website = input("Enter the website name: ")
    username = input("Enter the username: ")
    password = getpass.getpass("Enter the password: ")

    encrypted_password = encrypt_data(password, key)
    password_store[website] = {'username': username, 'password': encrypted_password}
    print(f"Password for {website} added successfully.")

# Retrieve a password
def retrieve_password(password_store: dict, key: bytes):
    website = input("Enter the website name to retrieve the password: ")

    if website in password_store:
        username = password_store[website]['username']
        encrypted_password = password_store[website]['password']
        decrypted_password = decrypt_data(encrypted_password, key)
        print(f"Website: {website}")
        print(f"Username: {username}")
        print(f"Password: {decrypted_password}")
    else:
        print(f"No password found for {website}.")

# Delete a password
def delete_password(password_store: dict):
    website = input("Enter the website name to delete the password: ")

    if website in password_store:
        del password_store[website]
        print(f"Password for {website} deleted successfully.")
    else:
        print(f"No password found for {website}.")

# Main function to interact with the password manager
def main():
    filename = 'passwords.json'

    # Prompt for master password
    master_password = getpass.getpass("Enter your master password: ")

    # Generate encryption key from the master password
    key = generate_key(master_password)

    # Load existing password store
    password_store = load_password_store(filename)

    while True:
        print("\nPassword Manager")
        print("1. Add password")
        print("2. Retrieve password")
        print("3. Delete password")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Choose an option: ")

        if choice == '1':
            add_password(password_store, key)
            save_password_store(filename, password_store)
        elif choice == '2':
            retrieve_password(password_store, key)
        elif choice == '3':
            delete_password(password_store)
            save_password_store(filename, password_store)
        elif choice == '4':
            print("Exiting password manager.")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Key Features:
1. **Encryption and Decryption**: 
   - The passwords are encrypted using the master password, which is processed through a key generation function.
   - The encrypted passwords are stored in the `passwords.json` file, making the data unreadable without the key.

2. **Master Password**: 
   - The master password is used to derive a symmetric encryption key, which is stored securely during the session.

3. **Password Storage**: 
   - Passwords are stored in JSON format, where each website entry contains the encrypted password and the associated username.

4. **Interactive Interface**:
   - The script offers an interactive menu to add, retrieve, and delete passwords.

### Security Considerations:
- **Master Password Security**: The master password is not stored anywhere, so it's crucial to remember it.
- **Encryption**: We use Fernet (AES encryption) for secure password storage. Make sure to protect your master password.
- **Password Deletion**: Passwords can be deleted, and this change is reflected in the file.

### Usage:
1. **Add Password**: You can add new passwords by entering the website name, username, and the password.
2. **Retrieve Password**: Fetch the username and password for a website by entering its name.
3. **Delete Password**: Remove an entry from the password store by specifying the website name.

This script provides a basic and secure password manager, but for real-world use, you should consider additional features such as:
- **Strong Master Password Validation**.
- **Hashing Master Password** instead of using it directly.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** for added security.
