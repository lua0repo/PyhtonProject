Creating a personal portfolio website using GitHub, similar to the Python Master theme, involves several steps. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to create your portfolio website using GitHub Pages and HTML/CSS.

Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
Sign in to your GitHub account (or create one if you don't have one yet).
Create a new repository by clicking on the + sign in the top-right corner and selecting New repository.
Name your repository something like username.github.io, where username is your GitHub username.
Set the repository to public and initialize it with a README file.
Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages
In your repository, go to the Settings tab.
Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
Under Source, choose main branch and click Save.
Your GitHub Pages site will now be live at https://username.github.io (replacing username with your GitHub username).
Step 3: Create the HTML Structure for Your Portfolio
You can create your portfolio using HTML for the structure and CSS for styling. Let's create a simple portfolio page with some basic sections.

Create an index.html file
In the repository, create a new file named index.html.
Add the following code to the index.html:

Step 4: Add Some Basic Styling with CSS
Create a styles.css file in your repository and add the following code for basic styling:

Step 5: Commit and Push the Files
After adding the index.html and styles.css files, go to your GitHub repository.
Youâ€™ll see your files listed. Commit the changes and push them to the GitHub repository.
Once pushed, your site will automatically update. Go to https://username.github.io (replace username with your GitHub username) to view your portfolio.
Step 6: Customize Your Portfolio
Update the content: Add more details about yourself in the "About Me" section.
Add projects: Add more projects in the "Projects" section and link to GitHub repositories.
Change styles: You can modify the colors, fonts, and layout in the styles.css file to match your preferences.
Step 7: Use a Custom Domain (Optional)
If you want to use a custom domain instead of the default GitHub URL, follow these steps:

Buy a domain (e.g., from Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.).
Go to the Settings of your GitHub repository and scroll to the GitHub Pages section.
Add your custom domain name under "Custom domain".
Update your domain's DNS settings to point to GitHub Pages by adding the following DNS records:
A record: 185.199.108.153
A record: 185.199.109.153
A record: 185.199.110.153
A record: 185.199.111.153
CNAME record for the subdomain (e.g., www).
After the DNS changes propagate (which can take a few hours), your site will be live at your custom domain.

Additional Steps (Optional)
Add JavaScript: If you want to add interactive elements like animations or modals, you can create a script.js file.
Use a Framework: For more advanced layouts, you could use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
Add Analytics: To track visitors, you can integrate Google Analytics or any other analytics tool.
